Words_occurrences

Algoriths and Data Structures subject's project

Make a program that:
- counts the number of occurrences of each distinct word of a text file
- records the location of the first and occurrences of each distinct word
- records the smallest, largest, and average distances between consecutive occurrences of the same distinct word
Your program:
- must use a hash table (separate chaining),
- the hash table size should grow dynamically,
- each hash table entry should point to either a linked list or an ordered binary tree.
